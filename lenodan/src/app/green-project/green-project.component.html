We work with local mills to produce our fabrics, which help to reduce the environmental impact associated with transportation.

                      <p class="mb-0">We also work closely with a handful of small factories and suppliers that believe in transparency and are committed to fair working conditions. We believe that garment workers are the heartbeat of our production line, from concept to execution, and we are committed to ensuring that they are treated with dignity and respect. We also aim to associate ourselves with factories that are keen on working sustainably and that will help us to focus more on slow fashion to minimize waste. We believe that by taking a slow fashion approach, we can create fashion that has less social and environmental impact. We also take into consideration the impact of our decisions at the top management level to their effect on the worker at factory level.</p>

                      <p class="mb-0">We are committed to reducing our use of plastic. We understand that plastic waste is a major contributor to pollution and we are committed to minimizing our impact on the environment. We have eliminated the use of single-use plastics such as plastic bags and plastic wrapping in our packaging. Instead, we use paper, jute, and cotton to make our packaging materials, which are renewable, biodegradable, and compostable. This means that they break down quickly and donâ€™t contribute to pollution. We also make sure to use minimal packaging, so as to reduce waste and decrease our environmental impact.</p>
